from danny thompson:
- anything personal/solves a problem in your own life
	- Example, A student of mine worked at a burger place. He complained about throwing away over 40lbs of expired product. I suggested making a program that logs inventory and expiration dates. It then sends an alert 3 days before expiring to remind you to use it and rotate product.
- furniture ecommerce website
	- You will have multiple products across multiple pages, a search feature, a cart where I click add to cart and on a separate page it stores that item and a checkout process. Also create it to where you can have an inventory tracker. Are you only backend focused? Then create the inventory system for the store without the frontend. Bonus points if you can create an alert that prompts the store to reorder certain products for out of stocks or low inventory on smaller items BUT NOT for bigger items.
- restaurant website that takes reservations
	- Bonus points if you make it send an email confirmation but not necessary.
- booking app
	- a user can reserve a time for a service. Example, a mechanic shop accepting appointments for car repairs. Bonus points if you can have it also keep track of the financials, like repairs & revenue generated, place it in a graph to visualize the info.
- a bug tracker
	- This is a big project. A bug tracker essentially shows the different stages of a task, tracking it along the process. image via google images, the basic idea is to show it going from the backlog (not worked on yet) to in progress, code review to done.
